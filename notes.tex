\title{Notes on lattice calculations}
\section{22 September 2013}
So far, I've been delving through the literature in order to get a handle on what I need to do and understand in this new arena. I've found a few things on lattice mismatch, BZO nanorods acting as dopants (or ``impurities'') in a YBCO film, and why we're interested in such structures (still need to look up vortex pinning).\\

An important equation for understanding superconducting current in the film:\\
\begin{equation}
\oint d\vec{l}\cdot\vec{H} = \kappa\int_{\partial\Omega}d\vec{S}\cdot\vec{J}_c = I_{free_{enc}}
\end{equation}
